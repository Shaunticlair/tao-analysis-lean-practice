Formalizing Terence Tao's Analysis I in Lean.

This project was started before I knew about Tao's Lean notebook at github.com/teorth/analysis. However, once I learned about it, I started using it to template my proofs. Thus, this project functions as a partial solutions guide.

Maybe I should've directly forked Tao's repo, but honestly, there's some stuff I wanted to skip (too impatient to load all of the Mathlib packages Tao includes, plus I skip some proofs I don't find interesting).
